# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, a comprehensive course that bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** represents the next evolution of artificial intelligence—systems that don't just process data in the cloud, but interact with and understand the physical world.

:::info Key Concept
Unlike traditional AI confined to screens and servers, Physical AI enables machines to navigate, perceive, manipulate, move, and communicate in real-world environments.
:::

## Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are uniquely positioned to excel in our human-centered world because they:

1. **Share Our Form Factor** - Can use tools and environments designed for humans
2. **Learn from Human Data** - Abundant training data from human demonstrations  
3. **Social Acceptance** - Familiar form factor reduces fear and increases trust

## Course Structure

This course is organized into **4 core modules** with **17 chapters**:

### 📚 Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Chapters 1-5 | Weeks 3-5**

Master ROS 2, the middleware that powers modern robotics.

- ROS 2 Architecture & Design Patterns
- Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions
- Python Package Development
- URDF for Humanoid Robots

### 🎮 Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
**Chapters 6-9 | Weeks 6-7**

Create photorealistic simulations before deploying to hardware.

- Gazebo Simulation Environment
- Physics & Sensor Simulation
- Unity High-Fidelity Rendering

### 🤖 Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
**Chapters 10-13 | Weeks 8-10**

Harness NVIDIA's AI platform for perception and navigation.

- Isaac SDK & Isaac Sim
- AI-Powered Perception
- Reinforcement Learning
- Sim-to-Real Transfer

### 🗣️ Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Chapters 14-17 | Weeks 11-13**

Combine vision, language, and action into unified systems.

- Humanoid Kinematics & Dynamics
- Bipedal Locomotion
